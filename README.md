Disclaimer: I am not an expert in this field, I have some knowledge of writing code (y = f(x)). Executing that worldview to understand the world.


# Brief

A virus is a piece of code.

It is a piece of code that can replicate itself.

Similar to a computer virus, a biological virus is a piece of code that can replicate itself.

Its goal is to destroy the host.

# How does it work?

Virus has a DNA.

DNA has instructions.

Instructions are compiled and executed by the host.

# How can we stop it?

Not sure.

But, the first step is to understand it.

What is the root code that it is executing.

Maybe we can find a way to stop it after that.
